# pandas-challenge

In this challenge I will act as the new Chief Data Scientist for a city's school district and analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
Using records of every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, I will aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance using pandas.
I will perform the necessary calculations to create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics:

I will also create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school:

Conclusion: 
### Based on the District Summary we can see that overall, the math and reading scores are = or >74% while the overall passing rate is much lower at 65%, indicating that the rate at which students are passing both classes is lower than the average scores. As Per School Summary, we can deduce that District school scores tend to be significantly lower as all District school scores sit around 55% for overall passing rate. Charter school scores, on the other hand, display significantly higher overall passing rates, mostly = or >90%. This is also proven by the Highest Performing Schools & Lowest Performing Schools dataframes, which display 5 Charter schools as top performers, and 5 District schools as bottom performers. While there is no clear relationship between per student/school budgets and overall performers, we can clearly see that school size and school type heavily impact student performance. We can conclude that the greater the school size, the lower the average & overall passing scores. Likewise, depending on whether the school type is District or Charter, the scores will be lower and greater, respectively.
